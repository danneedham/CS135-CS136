Self Check Problems

3.2
add(v) adds an element to the end of a vector, while add(i,v) adds an element to the vector at index i. 
3.3
add(i,v) adds an element to the vector at index i, pushing the element that was previously at that index to index i+1. set(i,v) changes the element currently at index i to the element v. 
3.4
Remove(v) removes the element v from the list, while remove(i) removes the element at index i. 
3.6
The vector implementation is an improvement because as long as the target word is less than 10 characters long, no new arrays need to be created, taking less space.
